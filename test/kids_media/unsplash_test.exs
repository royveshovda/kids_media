    # Integration tests would require HTTP mocking setup
    # These would test:
    # - Returns list of image URLs when API call is successful
    # - Builds correct API URL with encoded query parameters
    # - Handles various error conditions (401, timeout, malformed JSON)
    # - Handles empty results gracefully
    # - Properly encodes special characters in queries
